# kindle_my_clippings_exporter

this is a simple python script to parse the "my clippings.txt" file from the kindle and create a markdown for every book read with all the highlights.

this is a WiP, it only supports italian files but I'll add support for other langauges.

# how to use
create an input and an output directory, put the "my clippings.txt" file in the input directory and start main.py, this will create a mark down file for every book in the output folder
